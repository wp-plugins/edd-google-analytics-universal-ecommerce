Basic Ecommerce tracking for Easy Digital Downloads using Google Universal Analytics

== Description ==

Basic plugin allowing you to add Google Analytics Ecommerce tracking to Easy Digital Downloads. 
Assumes you already create a ga object at the top of the page, and have enabled Ecommerce on your GA dashboard.

Make sure you are already adding regular Universal Google Analytics code to the top of your page somehow.

The Google object must be called "ga".

For example, use the plugin [NK Google Analytics](http://www.marodok.com/nk-google-analytics/) with Tracking code location set to Head.
This plugin is available on the WordPress plugin repository, so search for it by name from your admin panel.

You must also have enabled 'Ecommerce' on your Google Analytics dashboard.

Tested with Easy Digital Downloads version 2.
